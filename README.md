# Sprofe1K - Language Learning Bot
http://t.me/sprofe_bot Telegram Bot to learn the new language words through space repetition algorithm

This is a simple Telegram bot that helps users learn a new language using a spaced repetition system. The bot uses frequency lists to select the most important words and phrases for the user to learn. The bot currently supports as many language pairs as there are frequency lists available. Simply add a new frequency list file to the project and the bot will be able to support that language pair.
